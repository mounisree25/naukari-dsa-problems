Problem statement
You are given a positive integer N, your task is to find all the Jumping Numbers smaller than or equal to N.

A number is defined as a Jumping Number if all adjacent digits in it have an absolute difference of 1.

Example :
2, 23, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers but 296 and 89498 are not.
Note:
The difference between ‘9’ and ‘0’ is not considered as 1. All single-digit numbers are considered as Jumping Numbers. 
Sample Input 1:
1
20
Sample Output 1:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
These are all the jumping numbers from 0 to 12 as all the single-digit numbers are jumping numbers and out of the two-digit numbers only 10 and 12 are the jumping numbers less than 20 as the absolute difference in the adjacent digits of 10 and 12 is 1.
Sample Input 2:
2
1
30
Sample Output 2:
0 1
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 21 23 

class Solution
{
public static ArrayList<Integer> jumpcount(int n)
{
ArrayList<Integer>list=new ArrayList<>();
  list.add(0);
for(int i=1;i<=9 && i<=n;i++)
{
  bfs(i,list,n);
}
Collections.sort(list);
return list;
}
public static void bfs(int num,ArrayList<Integer>list,int n)
{
ArrayList<Integer>list=new ArrayList<>();
Queue<Integer>queue=new LinkedList<>();
queue.offer(num);
while(!queue.isEmpty())
{
int curr=queue.poll();
if(curr>n) continue;
list.add(curr);
int last=curr%10;
if(last>0)
{
queue.offer(curr*10+(last-1));
}
if(last<9)
{
queue.offer(curr*10+(last+1));
}
}
}
}
